# SES-Web-Mentorship 
Introduction to the Internet and Web Development
The internet and web development are fascinating and continually evolving fields that offer countless opportunities for creativity, innovation, and learning. I thank the JKUAT SES team for this opportunity to mentor and train those of us who showed interest in this field in a three-month intensive mentorship program.
The following are things which I learnt during the first week of the mentorship.
What Is the Internet?
The internet is a vast global network that connects billions of devices worldwide. It enables communication, information sharing, and access to a wide range of resources. Here are some key concepts:

1. Protocols
The internet relies on a set of communication protocols, including HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) for web browsing, FTP (File Transfer Protocol) for file sharing, and many more. These protocols define how data is transmitted and received over the network.
2. IP Addresses
Every device connected to the internet has a unique IP (Internet Protocol) address, which serves as its identifier. IP addresses allow data packets to be routed to their destination.

3. Domain Names
Domain names, such as www.example.com, provide a human-friendly way to access websites. They are mapped to IP addresses using DNS (Domain Name System).

Web Development Basics
Now that we have a grasp of the internet, let's delve into web development. Web development involves creating websites and web applications. Here are some foundational concepts:

1. Front-End vs. Back-End
Web development is divided into two main categories: front-end and back-end. Front-end development focuses on the user interface, while back-end development handles server-side functionality and databases.

2. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is used for structuring web content. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) adds style and design, while JavaScript adds interactivity and functionality to web pages.

3. Frameworks and Libraries
Web developers often use frameworks and libraries like React, Angular, or jQuery to streamline development and enhance productivity.
